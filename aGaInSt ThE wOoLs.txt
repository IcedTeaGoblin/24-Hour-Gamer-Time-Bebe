You are a sheep. The farmer is shearing you. The sheep gets angry and decides to shave him/her back.

Sheep: I have a dream. That all sheep are created equal.
Come on sheeple, we must rise up against our oppressors. First they took our wool, then they took our testicles, next they will take our lives.
Come, join me, and together we will take their women and enslave their children. We will no longer be the farmed, but the farmers.

Goal of the game is to catch the farmer and shave off his/her hair.

Need to collect more sheep to move faster.

Every level, the farmer moves faster and you must collect more sheep in order to catch them.

Hitting an animal lowers your speed by decreasing the sheep collected.

Hitting a heavy static object resets your speed to zero.

Powerups: sheep magnet(imouto) attracts more sheep, etc, see jenny's thing

Farmer: I'm tired of these motherfucking sheep in this motherfucking plain.

Aggresive farmers make you lose more sheep appear; can kill with shear pickup

from the vehicles. the sheep must dodge all the children and defeat the schoolteachers. the sheep capture the schoolbuses
First the farm, then the world
